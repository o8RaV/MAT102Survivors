        Boggle board GUI	
        &1.1
        &Jane
        &As a user, I want to better view my boggle board. I want the ability to interactively select the letters in a boggle board, instead of typing them out.
        &Using JavaFx, implement a GUI that displays the letters in a boggle board in a grid-like shape. The individual letters will be implemented as JavaFX buttons.

        Red/green color adjustment	
        &1.2
        &Fred
        &As a user with red/green color blindness, I want the ability to clearly distinguish the letters in my boggle board from the board itself.
        &Create a version of the GUI that avoids red/green color combinations. Using the MVC design pattern, the event-handler will directly change the view to reflect this version of the GUI.

        Font Change
        &1.3
        &Abdu
        &As a user with dyslexia, changing the font of a text can help me read more effectively. 
        &Present a list of fonts to the user. After the user selects the desired font, every character in the application will change to that font.

         Letter Highlight
        &1.4
        &Salah
        &As a player, I want to see the letters I have selected on the boggle board. 
        &Highlight letters with a different color as a user selects them. Using the MVC design pattern, the event hangler will directly change the view as the letter selection occurs.

        Keep Track of Score
        &1.5
        &Abutreka
        &As a user, I want to keep track of my current score as I find new valid words. 
        &Once a valid word is submitted, the score will be updated using the observer design pattern. The dictionary of valid words will notify the “Score” GUI element to change.
